# The JavaScript Speed Reader 0.30

The JavaScript Speed Reader is a self-contained, single-file, easy-to-use speed reading program for use in HTML5 capable desktop browsers.

## Introduction

There is so much information that we must read each day, and the "to read" pile just keeps growing. And yet, our time is precious and valuable. The JavaScript Speed Reader is here to help!

### While playing

* Up and down arrows display words faster or slower.
* Right and left arrows skip back or skip ahead in the text.
* Spacebar pauses.
* Escape stops.
* Uncheck `Display multiple words` if you find it a bit difficult to keep up.

You're now ready to read faster than ever before.

## How it works

Each time we move our eyes as we read, we have to search for the best place to look at each word to help our mind recognize the word we're reading. That takes time. The JavaScript Speed Reader calculates the best reading location to recognize each word or phrase, and makes each word's best reading location appear in the same place every time. Now your eyes don't have to search around. You understand words faster, and you can read more in less time while still maintaining high comprehension of what you read.

## Easy to use

The JavaScript Speed Reader was designed to be easy to use. Simply drag and drop the `speedreader.html` file onto your web browser to start the program. If you use the JavaScript Speed Reader often, you can add the JavaScript Speed Reader as a bookmark in your browser for fast and easy access.

To read an article or book, copy the text into the text box, adjust the `Speed` (in words-per-minute) if desired, and click Play (&#x25ba;).
